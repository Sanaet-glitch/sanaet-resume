            "description": "I'm a software developer who builds with a security-first mindset. My development background is practical and results-oriented; I've led projects where I delivered a 20% performance boost on a website redesign and co-designed an internal tool that cut IT resolution times by 55%. <br>But my true passion is security. That focus was solidified when I helped maintain 99.5% network uptime for critical infrastructure; I saw firsthand how vital resilience is. That experience drove me to earn my IBM Cybersecurity Professional certificate, where I dove deep into vulnerability assessment, security posture evaluation, and incident response. It confirmed this is my field.</br><br>To me, security and development aren't separate fields, which is why I'm always learning. I'm now pushing deeper by getting my AWS Cloud Practitioner certification, specifically to master cloud-native security principles and understand how to build secure infrastructure from the ground up.</br><br>I believe the future of technology lies at this intersection. I'm passionate about building that future, one where we engineer solutions that are not only efficient but fundamentally trustworthy from the first line of code.</br>"
